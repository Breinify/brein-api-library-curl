# Breinify's API
<sup>Features: **Temporal Data**, **(Reverse) Geocoding**, **Events**, **Weather**, **Holidays**, **Analytics**</sup>

[Breinify's API](https://www.breinify.com) provides tasks like `geocoding`, `reverse geocoding`, `weather and events look up`, `holidays determination` through the API's endpoints, i.e., `/activity` and `/temporaldata`. Each endpoint provides different features, see [Documentation](https://www.breinify.com/documentation/index.html).

**Activity Endpoint**: The endpoint is used to understand the usage-patterns and the behavior of a user using, e.g., an application, a mobile app, or a web-browser. The endpoint offers analytics and insights through Breinify's dashboard.

**TemporalData Endpoint**: The endpoint offers features to resolve temporal information like a timestamp, a location (latitude and longitude or free-text), or an IP-address, to temporal information (e.g., timezone, epoch, formatted dates, day-name),  holidays at the specified time and location, city, zip-code, neighborhood, country, or county of the location, events at the specified time and location (e.g., description, size, type), weather at the specified time and location (e.g., description, temperature).
